# RemWaste Skip Hire Application

A modern, responsive application for waste management and skip hire services, built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a user-friendly interface for a waste management company, showcasing modern web development practices and advanced UI/UX patterns. The application allows users to select different skip sizes, compare options, and proceed to checkout with a streamlined booking process.

## Technical Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **React + React Router 7**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient virtual DOM rendering
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety, better IDE support, and improved code maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent styling
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animation library for smooth, performant transitions
- **ShadCN UI**: High-quality, accessible component library built on Radix UI
- **Context API**: Built-in React state management for global application state

### Key Technical Decisions

   - Implemented a custom theme system with dark/light mode support
   - Used CSS variables for dynamic theme switching
   - Added system theme detection and persistence
   - Implemented smooth transitions between themes
   - Used localStorage for theme preference persistence

3. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implemented code splitting with React Router
   - Used lazy loading for components
   - Optimized animations with Framer Motion
   - Implemented proper memoization where needed
   - Used CSS containment for better rendering performance

4. **Security Measures**

   - Implemented demo expiration mechanism
   - Added code protection features
   - Used environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implemented proper input validation
   - Added security headers

5. **Accessibility Features**
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
